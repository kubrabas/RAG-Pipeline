- Preprocessing and Embedding Creation.ipynb: In this notebook, I have generated embeddings that can be used later to retrieve relevant passages.
- chunks_and_embeddings_for_ParkAllee.csv: The CSV file including the embeddings and related information corresponding the embedding. Created for the pdf document named "ParkAllee"
- chunks_and_embeddings_for_WeitBlick.csv: The CSV file including the embeddings and related information corresponding the embedding. Created for the pdf document named "WeitBlick"
- RAG pipeline.ipynb: Using this notebook, you can ask questions about the PDFs to our LLM model. Optionally, you can also inquire about the page from which our LLM model retrieved the information to provide the answers.
